# Damien | Minecraft Plugin Developer

I'm a 23-year-old blue-collar worker with a strong passion for IT and software development. Although I don't have formal training in the field, I've pursued it independently, developing practical skills through real-world projects—especially within the Minecraft plugin development scene.

I focus on creating gameplay-enhancing and utility-based plugins using Java and Kotlin, with an emphasis on clean code, server performance, and immersive player experiences.

## Projects

### Reclaim
A donation reward system designed for long-term servers with seasonal resets. Players can store donator items in a GUI-based vault that persists between seasons, allowing them to reclaim their rewards when a new season begins. Enhances donor retention and simplifies reward management.

### PVE Plugin
A fully completed PvE system featuring wave-based spawning, countdowns, region selections via wands, and spectating mechanics. Built to support dynamic, repeatable PvE events that are easy for server staff to configure and manage.

### AdminToolsPlus (ATP) — *Work in Progress*
A modular, admin-focused toolkit designed to simplify day-to-day server management. Currently in its early stages, the plugin is functional and available for download, with active development planned for expanded functionality and deeper customization.

### AuraEnhancer — *Work in Progress*
An advanced aura system that lets players equip animated, particle-driven auras which apply status effects to themselves and nearby players. Configurable through YAML, it supports spiral, wing, and sphere animations for a highly immersive and dramatic gameplay presence. Designed for boss fights, prestige rewards, and cosmetic enhancements.
