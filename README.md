I'm a 23-year-old blue-collar worker with a strong passion for IT and software development. Although I don't have formal training in the field, I've pursued it independently, developing practical skills through real-world projects—especially within the Minecraft plugin development scene.

I focus on creating gameplay-enhancing and utility-based plugins using Java and Kotlin, with an emphasis on clean code, server performance, and immersive player experiences.
