# Damien | Minecraft Plugin Developer

I'm a 23-year-old blue-collar worker with a strong passion for IT and software development. Although I don't have formal training in the field, I've pursued it independently, developing practical skills through real-world projects—especially within the Minecraft plugin development scene.

I focus on creating gameplay-enhancing and utility-based plugins using Java and Kotlin, with an emphasis on clean code, server performance, and immersive player experiences.

## Projects

### Reclaim
A donation reward system designed for long-term servers with seasonal resets. Players can store donator items in a GUI-based vault that persists between seasons, allowing them to reclaim their rewards when a new season begins. Enhances donor retention and simplifies reward management.

### PVE Plugin
A fully completed PvE system featuring wave-based spawning, countdowns, region selections via wands, and spectating mechanics. Built to support dynamic, repeatable PvE events that are easy for server staff to configure and manage.

### ShadowAscend
A Solo Leveling-inspired RPG plugin that introduces stat-based progression, daily quests, and shadow minion mechanics. Players level up, allocate stats, and extract shadows from defeated mobs to build personal armies. Future updates will include dungeons, faction alignment, and an ascension system—creating a deep, lore-driven experience in Minecraft.
